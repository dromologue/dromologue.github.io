I"—<p>Junior staff often ask me, â€œwhat does it take to be promoted?â€ I am honest and donâ€™t pretend. I say, â€œIt takes fitting in with how the organisation youâ€™re in thinks a leader or manager should behave.â€ Itâ€™s not about performance really. Many people perform well and dont get promoted. Itâ€™s about alignment. This doesnâ€™t mean that organisations with different behaviour expectations necessarily have different values, or espouse different values. Rather, the values that you would expect a large corporate to espouse are probably there in equal measure. But the behaviours show the organisationâ€™s attitude to how they should be modeled.</p>
