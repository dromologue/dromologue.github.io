<p>Over the last ten years, working with agile, DevOps and lean startup methods, I have developed an approach to building and improving digital products and the teams that build them.</p>

<h2 id="arbuckles-second-law">Arbuckle‚Äôs Second Law:</h2>
<p><em>As with products, teams that improve more slowly than the markets they serve are doomed for disruption or irrelevance.</em></p>

<h2 id="arbuckles-third-law">Arbuckle‚Äôs Third Law:</h2>
<p><em>In the majority of teams only 10% of features developed actually produce the kind of customer behaviour that generate revenue.</em></p>

<p>(The first law has to do with <a href="https://twitter.com/dromologue/status/575686167229775874">compliance</a>.)</p>

<p>I call teams shaped in response to these ‚Äòlaws‚Äô, the <em>accelerated product team</em>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-accelerated-product-team">What is an <em>accelerated product team</em>?</h2>
<p>An accelerated product team:</p>
<ul>
  <li>is agile.</li>
  <li>deploys daily to live production using continuous delivery.</li>
  <li>defines and tests hypotheses of customer behaviour in small pieces and only further invests in those that are proven.</li>
  <li>is full stack. Consisting of all those involved in building and supporting the product, from ‚Äòproduct owner‚Äô to ‚Äòoperations‚Äô.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-do-i-build-an-accelerated-product-team">How do I build an accelerated product team?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Don‚Äôt worry about scale until you have a scale problem (which is a good problem to have). Start with one product and set revenue and growth targets for it.</li>
  <li>Dedicate team resources to the product - this is your new product team.</li>
  <li>Get someone who can coach technical and commercial team members in how to work and improve both the team and the product together.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-do-i-start">How do I start?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I suggest 3 day workshop. I call it the ‚ÄúAccelerated Product Workshop‚Äù This is the best place to start. You can run this workshop yourself using these tools.</li>
  <li>The APW guides a dedicated team of resources and their leadership in shaping a backlog of work that builds a compelling outcome for the customer one sprint at a time.</li>
</ul>
