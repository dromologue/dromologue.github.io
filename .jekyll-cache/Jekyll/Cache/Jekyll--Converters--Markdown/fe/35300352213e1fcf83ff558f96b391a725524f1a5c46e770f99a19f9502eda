I"<p>As we consider how to transform our enterprises - in whatever form that might take - we often only have a vague idea of what the ultimate target for transformation might be. Of course, we spend a great deal of time elaborating what the ‘next’ step should be - say a single product team for a single product - but we are often so engrossed in the pragmatic next step that we ignore the visionary ultimate goal. After the synaptic sugar of stating the destination, we devolve quickly to checking the signposts.</p>
