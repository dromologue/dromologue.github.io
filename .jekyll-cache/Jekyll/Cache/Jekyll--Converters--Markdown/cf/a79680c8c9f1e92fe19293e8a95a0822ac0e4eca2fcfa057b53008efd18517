<p>In this post I share some personal insights into driving the adoption of new transformative technology, like DevOps or Continuous Delivery, across a large enterprise. I do so with the help of a whale. Perhaps you have never read “Moby Dick”. Don’t worry. This is not about Moby Dick and if there is a test at the end, it will be a test that you had coming anyway. This great adventure story serves as a powerful allegory for how we drive sustainable change in organisations. If that is how you’re being tested right now… follow the whale.</p>
