<h2 id="pre-work">Pre Work</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I meet with the sponsor - An executive in the company that can influence the appropriate identification and allocation of resources.</li>
  <li>The objective is to identify 1or 2 products - i.e. an application or service offered to customers - that we will work on for the next 6-8 weeks.</li>
  <li>Through some early interviews with some future team members, business leaders and other influencers I attempt to understand the competitive and commercial context of the product and the technical practises used by the development teams.</li>
  <li>I use a checklist from the open source transformation repo that I maintain. This is <a href="https://github.com/dromologue/ContinuousTransformation/blob/master/TechnicalWorkshop/Checklist.md">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>–&gt; Outcome: Well defined product(s) and teams available to work in a dedicated manner for the next 6-8 weeks.</em></p>

<h2 id="day-1">Day 1</h2>
<p>Day 1 is all about setting the context of a new way of working. This includes a discussion of some well known models and some new ones developed in my practise:</p>
<h3 id="content">Content</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Agile, Lean, DevOps (ALDO) - drawing on Toyota TPS, Agile Manifesto, Continuous Delivery and DevOps Kung Fu.</li>

  <li>The HSM - High Stakes Moment</li>
  <li>The Operating Chasm</li>
  <li>The ‘Hands-up’ Problem</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s not just talking, there should be lots of activity and plenty of group exercises. Don’t use slideware - have conversations.</p>

<h3 id="attendees">Attendees</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All team members already identified.</li>
  <li>Senior leaders who also need / want to understand the new approaches.</li>
  <li>Other influencers in the organisation.</li>

  <li>A shared perspective on how we can work better with each other and our customers to achieve continuous improvement.</li>
  <li>Confirmation of the products to be worked on and the teams that will work on them.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="day-2">Day 2</h2>
<p>Day 2 is when things get real.</p>

<h3 id="content-1">Content</h3>
<p>During this day, for each product we identify:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A longer term product increment goal - What do we think is really going to shift the needle? This is the HSM.</li>
  <li>A user story map that describes this.</li>
  <li>Areas of improvement for the team to be worked on during the delivery of the product goal.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p>Day 3 focuses on building a first sprint of two weeks and building the capability within the team to keep on doing it using the new methods introduced.</p>
<h3 id="content-2">Content</h3>
<ul>
