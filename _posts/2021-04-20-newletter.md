excerpt:  Behaviour matters
---

Junior staff often ask me, "what does it take to be promoted?" I am honest and don't pretend. I say, "It takes fitting in with how the organisation you're in thinks a leader or manager should behave." It's not about performance really. Many people perform well and dont get promoted. It's about alignment. This doesn't mean that organisations with different behaviour expectations necessarily have different values, or espouse different values. Rather, the values that you would expect a large corporate to espouse are probably there in equal measure. But the behaviours show the organisation's attitude to how they should be modeled.
