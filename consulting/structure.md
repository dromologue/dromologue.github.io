## Pre Work
+ I meet with the sponsor - An executive in the company that can influence the appropriate identification and allocation of resources.
+ The objective is to identify 1or 2 products - i.e. an application or service offered to customers - that we will work on for the next 6-8 weeks.
+ Through some early interviews with some future team members, business leaders and other influencers I attempt to understand the competitive and commercial context of the product and the technical practises used by the development teams.
+ I use a checklist from the open source transformation repo that I maintain. This is [here](https://github.com/dromologue/ContinuousTransformation/blob/master/TechnicalWorkshop/Checklist.md).

*--> Outcome: Well defined product(s) and teams available to work in a dedicated manner for the next 6-8 weeks.*

## Day 1
Day 1 is all about setting the context of a new way of working. This includes a discussion of some well known models and some new ones developed in my practise:
### Content 
+ Agile, Lean, DevOps (ALDO) - drawing on Toyota TPS, Agile Manifesto, Continuous Delivery and DevOps Kung Fu.
+ Lean Startup
+ Conway's Law
+ Kanter's 4 Player Model
+ De Bono's 6 Thinking Hats
+ IOTA Model
+ The Lazy J Model
+ ELSA Model
+ The HSM - High Stakes Moment
+ The Operating Chasm
+ The 'Hands-up' Problem

It's not just talking, there should be lots of activity and plenty of group exercises. Don't use slideware - have conversations. 

### Attendees
+ All team members already identified. 
+ Senior leaders who also need / want to understand the new approaches.
+ Other influencers in the organisation. 

### Outcome 
+ A shared perspective on how we can work better with each other and our customers to achieve continuous improvement.
+ Confirmation of the products to be worked on and the teams that will work on them.

## Day 2
Day 2 is when things get real. 

### Content
During this day, for each product we identify:
+ A longer term product increment goal - What do we think is really going to shift the needle? This is the HSM. 
+ A user story map that describes this.
+ Areas of improvement for the team to be worked on during the delivery of the product goal.

### Attendees
+ All of the members of the product teams.
+ Those from Day 1 able / wanting to attend. (it's usually pretty high)

### Outcome
+ A clearly defined goal for the product.
+ Some open questions or hypotheses about how certain customer behaviour will drive revenue for your product.
+ Teams already beginning to gel and operate as a cohesive unit. 

## Day 3
Day 3 focuses on building a first sprint of two weeks and building the capability within the team to keep on doing it using the new methods introduced.
### Content
+ We use the IOTA model for much of Day 3.
+ We split the planning into micro-chunks of 15 minutes using the ROAR approach. 

### Attendees
+ Full product teams as before. 
+ Senior leadership at the end of day 3 to be presented the plan. 

### Outcome
+ A fully defined sprint to be started the next day.
+ Identification of additional resources or other obstacles that senior leadership need to assist in addressing. 

## Logistics
+ 1 Flipchart for the facilitator and 1 each for each of the product teams. 
+ Lots of sticky notes.
+ Working flipchart pens. 
+ Coffee / tea on tap.
+ Offsite location is preferable as it stops people being dragged into things. 
+ A room with space to move around in. No tables, just chairs in a large circle.
