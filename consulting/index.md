# Accelerated Product Teams

Over the last ten years, working with agile, DevOps and lean startup methods, I have developed an approach to building and improving digital products and the teams that build them. 

## Arbuckle's Second Law:
*As with products, teams that improve more slowly than the markets they serve are doomed for disruption or irrelevance.*

## Arbuckle's Third Law:
*In the majority of teams only 10% of features developed actually produce the kind of customer behaviour that generate revenue.*

(The first law has to do with [compliance](https://twitter.com/dromologue/status/575686167229775874).)

I call teams shaped in response to these 'laws', the _accelerated product team_.

## What is an _accelerated product team_?
An accelerated product team:
+ is agile.
+ deploys daily to live production using continuous delivery.
+ defines and tests hypotheses of customer behaviour in small pieces and only further invests in those that are proven.
+ is full stack. Consisting of all those involved in building and supporting the product, from 'product owner' to 'operations'.

## How do I build an accelerated product team?
+ Don't worry about scale until you have a scale problem (which is a good problem to have). Start with one product and set revenue and growth targets for it.
+ Dedicate team resources to the product - this is your new product team. 
+ Get someone who can coach technical and commercial team members in how to work and improve both the team and the product together. 

## How do I start?
+ I suggest 3 day workshop. I call it the "Accelerated Product Workshop" This is the best place to start. You can run this workshop yourself using these tools.
+ The APW guides a dedicated team of resources and their leadership in shaping a backlog of work that builds a compelling outcome for the customer one sprint at a time.
